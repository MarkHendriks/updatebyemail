## Project Update

A centralised timeline overview of all project updates.
Simply send your update by email (subject and message) to add it to the timeline.

### Demo
Live demo at https://updatebyemail.meteor.com
This demo uses Mailgun to route the incoming email but you could also use Sendgrid.

__note:__ I'm new to Meteor and javascript. Some of my code might be what you call bad practice :)
